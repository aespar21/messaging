The **messaging** Package
=========================

The goal of **messaging** is to provides a toolset for creating and issuing nicely-formatted text within R diagnostic messages and those messages given during warnings and errors. The formatting of the messages can be customized using templating features. Issues with singular and plural forms can be handled through specialized syntax.
